# Accessibility statement for check planning and housing data for England

This accessibility statement applies to the check planning and housing data for England service (publish.development.digital-land.info).

This service is run by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service. For example, that means you should be able to:

-   change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings
-   zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen
-   navigate most of the service using a keyboard or speech recognition software
-   listen to most of the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We've also made the service text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## Technical information about this service's accessibility

The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) is committed to making this service accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

### Compliance status

This service is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard, due to the non-compliance listed below.

## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

#### Some content is not suitable for screen readers

The service uses field names from the data standards. These are written in lower case, which means they may not always be read out correctly by screen readers. For example, 'document-url' may not spell out the letters of URL. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.1.6 (Pronunciation).

We plan to review field names in 2024.
