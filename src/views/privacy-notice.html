# Submit and update planning and housing data for England privacy notice


## Who we are

Submit and update planning and housing data for England ([submit.planning.data.gov.uk](https://submit.planning.data.gov.uk)) is provided by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG).

MHCLG is the data controller for the service.


## What personal data we collect

The personal data we collect from you includes:



* your name and email address when you email a planning and housing dataset to us
* your name and email address if you send us feedback


## Other data we collect

We also record how you use the service, including which pages you visit and what you click on. This helps us to improve the service experience and make sure it’s meeting your needs. No personal data is recorded.


## Why we need your personal data

We collect your personal data to:



* respond to any feedback you send us, if you have asked us to
* contact you with any feedback we have about a planning and housing dataset you have sent us


## Why our use of your personal data is lawful

The legal basis for processing all personal data is that it’s necessary:



* to perform a task in the public interest
* in the exercise of our functions as a government department


## How we use your personal data

The personal data we collect may be shared with other government departments, agencies and public bodies. It may also be shared with our technology suppliers, for example our hosting provider.

We will share your personal data if we are required to do so by law - for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.

We will not:



* sell or rent your personal data to third parties
* share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes


## How long we keep your personal data

Personal data collected when you submit planning and housing data or a feedback form on the service is kept for as long as we need the personal data for the purposes of research, security or delivery of the service.


## Children’s privacy protection

Our services are not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children 13 years of age or younger. We do not intentionally collect or maintain personal data about anyone under the age of 13.


## Where your personal data is processed and stored

We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your personal data is as safe as possible at all stages, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored.

All personal data is stored in the [European Economic Area](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea) (EEA).

Where personal data processing happens in the US, suppliers need to meet the certification standards set out in the [UK-US data bridge](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-us-data-bridge-supporting-documents/uk-us-data-bridge-explainer) agreement. This facilitates flows of personal data to certified US companies that have opted in to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.


## How we protect your personal data and keep it secure

We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your personal data secure. We have set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of your personal data - for example, we protect your personal data using varying levels of encryption.

We also make sure that any third parties that we deal with keep all personal data they process on our behalf secure.


## Your data protection rights

You have the right to request:



* information about how your personal data is processed
* a copy of that personal data
* that anything inaccurate in your personal data is corrected immediately

You can also:



* raise an objection about how your personal data is processed
* request that your personal data is erased if there is no longer a justification for it
* ask that the processing of your personal data is restricted in certain circumstances

If you have any of these requests, get in contact with our Knowledge and Information Access Team.
