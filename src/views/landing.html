    <p class="govuk-body">Having a national index of planning data means developers, housing associations, policy
      colleagues, researchers and journalists can access the data they need simply and quickly.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">It means less overhead for local authorities and organisations, reducing the time spent
      preparing for data requests and freedom of information requests.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The data is updated from local authority websites every night, ensuring the data is up-to-date
      and complete.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Your organisation is responsible for providing authoritative local data, which is why you must
      publish it on your website.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You need to provide information about the data on your website including links to the data itself. This can be a
      simple file hosted on your website, but it’s better if it is supplied through an API that links directly to your
      planning database software.

      The submit and update service tells you which datasets you need to provide, gives you information about the data
      you have provided and what you can do to improve the data quality.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Your data doesn’t need to be complete or perfect to start. Any data we have from you means we can start to index
      it and provide it on the platform. And we can help you to identify what data needs improvement and how to do it,
      so you can focus your time on making things better.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The dashboard gives you a clear view of the data you’ve supplied as well as other information we hold about your
      local area.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">As we grow the service we’ll add more features to help you to improve your data.</p>
