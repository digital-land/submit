## Running the application

The application picks up one of the configs in `config` directory,
depeding on `NODE_ENV` environment variable (set to 'production' by default).

You can start the appliction in one fo the following ways (see "scripts" section
of [package.json](package.json)) for more examples.

- Run the application
    ```
    npm run start
    ```
- Run the application, using a local API
    ```
    npm run start:local
    ```
- Run the application, using a local API in watch mode
    ```
    npm run start:local:watch
    ```
- Run the application using docker
    ```
    docker compose -f docker-compose-real-backend.yml up
    ```
- Run the application (without the frontend) using docker
    ```
    docker compose -f docker-compose-real-backend-minus-frontend.yml up
    ```
- Run external services in containers and start application
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

### Mac users only

If you are a Mac user, please note that port 5000 is used by AirPlay Receiver. In order to use the application, you will need to switch off AirPlay Receiver
or update your local config to use a different port.

To switch off AirPlay Receiver, follow these steps:
1. Open System Preferences on your Mac.
2. Search for "AirDrop & Handoff".
3. In the "AirPlay Receiver" toggle, select "Off".

Once you have switched off AirPlay Receiver, you should be able to use the application without any issues.

## Jira Integration (for local development)

The application has a Jira integration that allows you to create and update Jira issues from the application.
Most of this code is in the `src/services/jiraService.js` file.

Prerequisites:
- A Jira Service Desk instance
- A Jira user with the following permissions:
    - Create issues in the Jira Service Desk
    - Edit issues in the Jira Service Desk
    - View issues in the Jira Service Desk

### Generating the Jira basic auth credentials

```
echo -n user@example.com:api_token_string | base64
```

You can read more about JIRA Basic Auth [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/).

### How to enable Jira integration

1. Go to the .env file
2. Add the following variables:

```
JIRA_URL=your_jira_url
JIRA_BASIC_AUTH=your_jira_basic_auth
JIRA_SERVICE_DESK_ID=your_jira_service_desk_id
```

or do the following:

Warning: This will overwrite your existing .env file.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit the .env file with the correct values.

### How to create a test Jira Service Desk for local development

1. Go to [JIRA Service Desk](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-desk/try)
2. Click on "Try for free"
3. Fill in the form and create a test instance
4. In the "Users" section, create a new user
5. In the "Projects" section, create a new project
6. In the "Service Desk" section, create a new service desk - get the service desk ID (this is the `JIRA_SERVICE_DESK_ID` env variable)
7. Get an API key for the new user, this can be found in the user's profile page
8. Get the Jira URL (this is the `JIRA_URL` env variable)
9. Generate the Jira basic auth credentials (this is the `JIRA_BASIC_AUTH` env variable). This is the username and password of the new user, separated by a colon then encoded in base64.
